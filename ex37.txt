1. Python functions are blocks of organized and reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.

Functions provide standardized units for reusing code

There are built in functions like print() which prints variables and quoted statements.

Then def(), which defines any input parameters or arguments that should be placed within the parentheses

The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented

2. Usually, the variables get assigned a value when the integer variables are being declared.


A flowchart is a diagram of the sequence of movements or actions of people or things involved in a complex system or activity.
